# Duothan 4.0 - Solution by Team Meta-Fours

## Introduction
Neotropolis, a cutting-edge futuristic city, is facing challenges in managing its transport system efficiently. With the city's rapid growth and technological advancements, traditional transport systems are proving inadequate. As a result, the city is witnessing traffic congestion, parking issues, and inefficient public transport.

To address these challenges, Neotropolis aims to implement a Smart Transport Management System (STMS) that integrates various transport modes, optimizes traffic flow, and provides seamless connectivity for residents and visitors.

## Problem Statement
When someone arrives in Neotropolis, they should park their vehicle at the "Collective Neotropolis Parkinglot". The system will issue a digital ticket through a web interface, which will serve as a comprehensive transport pass. This digital ticket should control everything related to transport, including public transport access, payments, tracking, and more. However, building such a system requires addressing several key functionalities:

### Digital Transport Pass:
- Issue digital tickets to users upon parking.
- Integrate with public transport systems for seamless access.
- Enable cashless payments for parking and public transport.

### Real-time Transport Tracking:
- Track the location of public transport vehicles in real-time.
- Provide users with accurate arrival times and route information.

### Integrated Payment System:
- Allow users to top-up their transport passes.
- Enable contactless payments for all transport services.

### Traffic Optimization and Management:
- Analyze traffic patterns to optimize signal timings.
- Provide alternative routes during congestion to reduce travel time.

### User-Friendly Web Interface:
- Enable users to easily manage their transport pass.
- Futuristic User Interface
- Provide a comprehensive dashboard displaying transport options, payments, and journey history.

## Solution
Contestants are tasked with developing a web-based Smart Transport Management System for Neotropolis. The system should have the following features:

- Digital Transport Pass (DTP) System: Issue digital tickets to users upon parking, which serve as a comprehensive transport pass for Neotropolis.
- Real-time Transport Tracking: Provide users with real-time tracking of public transport vehicles and accurate arrival times.
- Integrated Payment System: Allow users to manage and top-up their transport passes, and make contactless payments for all transport services.
- Traffic Optimization and Management: Implement algorithms to analyze traffic patterns, optimize signal timings, and provide alternative routes during congestion.
- User-Friendly Web Interface: Develop an intuitive web interface where users can easily manage their transport pass, view options, make payments, and track their journey history.

## Technical Requirements
- Build the application using any modern web framework.
- Use an efficient database to store information about users, vehicles, parking spaces, public transport, and payments.
- Implement RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend. Note: You can use an API Manager Platform (Postman/insomnia) when demonstrating APIs.
- All the Major entities (such as Users, TransportPass, etc.â€¦) should have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update Delete) operations and both API and your solutions should be able to demonstrate it.
- Ensure the application is scalable to handle a large number of users and data.
- All Endpoints must use proper HTTP Status codes to indicate the status of the request.
- For any internal Users, use of General Auth Providers is not recommended. For example, using Google Auth or Firebase Auth is not recommended for Internal Users such as Admins or Pharmacies.
- Implement security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 01: Backend Development and Database
- Develop backend logic for issuing digital tickets, managing transport data, and handling payments.
- Implement an efficient database to store all necessary information.

### Task 02: Real-time Transport Tracking and Optimization (API Expected)
- Implement real-time tracking of public transport vehicles.
- Develop algorithms for traffic optimization and alternative route suggestions.

### Task 03: Integrated Payment System
- Implement payment processing for topping up transport passes and making payments for parking and public transport.

### Task 04: User-Friendly Web Interface
- Design and develop an intuitive web interface for users to manage their transport pass, view transport options, and make payments.
- High-Tech Futuristic User Interface (Additional Points)

### Task 05: Teamwork and Collaboration
- Collaborate effectively as a team to ensure seamless integration of all components and deliver a functional Smart Transport Management System for Neotropolis.
